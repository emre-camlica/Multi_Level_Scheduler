# Multi_Level_Scheduler
A multi level scheduler I designed as a homework in Data Structures Course, using a given templete.
The ProcessRep file constructs the process class, which represents the processes scheduled by the schedular.
The FIFORep file defines the first in first out queue structure which is the way the processes in the simulation are scheduled.
The CPURep file creates the CPU class which the processes are executed.
In the SchedulerRep file, the functions for scheduling are defined. 
The main function was given to us by the instructors.
